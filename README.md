Be Early on all G8keep token Launched. Trade An Unruggable Token  faster. To Be early is the Edge

## Overview
G8keep is a launchpad platform specifically designed for launching memecoins. It is currently deployed on two blockchains: Base and Abstract Chain. What sets G8keep apart from other launchpads is its unique mechanism for token launches.  

G8keep incorporates sniper protection at the contract level for every token launched through the platform. This feature ensures that no user can acquire a disproportionately large percentage of the token supply during the launch. The sniper protection is active for the first 15 minutes, after which the token functions as a standard ERC20 token, allowing users to purchase any available percentage.  

The primary purpose of this sniper protection is to prevent a single individual from monopolising a large portion of the token supply during the launch, ensuring a fairer distribution.
